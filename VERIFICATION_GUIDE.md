## Summary of Fixes Applied

This document summarizes the fixes that have been applied to resolve issues with restored file detection and duplicate deletion records.

### 1. Restored File Detection Fix

**Problem:** When a file was deleted and then restored, the sync process wasn't detecting it as new.

**Solution:** Modified `/src/core/change_detector.py` to check if an existing file's latest record has status='deleted'. If so, it treats the file as NEW when it reappears.

```python
# If the latest record shows the file was deleted, treat it as new (restored)
if existing_record.status == FileStatus.DELETED.value:
    changes.append(FileChange(
        uri=uri,
        change_type=ChangeType.NEW,
        metadata=metadata,
        existing_record=existing_record  # Keep reference for UUID generation
    ))
```

### 2. Duplicate Deletion Prevention Fix

**Problem:** Already-deleted files were getting duplicate deletion records on subsequent sync runs.

**Solution:** Modified `/src/core/change_detector.py` to only mark files as deleted if they aren't already marked as deleted.

```python
# Only mark as deleted if it's not already marked as deleted
if existing_record.status != FileStatus.DELETED.value:
    changes.append(FileChange(
        uri=uri,
        change_type=ChangeType.DELETED,
        existing_record=existing_record
    ))
```

### 3. Database Constraint Violation Fix

**Problem:** Error handling was creating FileRecord entries with null rag_uri values, violating database constraints.

**Solution:** Modified `/src/core/batch_runner.py` to provide valid dummy RAG URIs for error records.

```python
# Create error record - need to provide a dummy RAG URI since it's required
error_rag_uri = f"{kb_name}/error-{datetime.now().timestamp()}"
error_record = FileRecord(
    sync_run_id=sync_run_id,
    original_uri=change.uri,
    rag_uri=error_rag_uri,  # Provide a value since it's required
    file_hash="",  # Empty string instead of None
    uuid_filename="",  # Empty string instead of None
```

### 4. Directory Creation Fix

**Problem:** FileSystemStorage wasn't creating necessary directories, causing "No such file or directory" errors.

**Solution:** Modified `/src/implementations/file_system_storage.py` to create the documents directory during initialization.

```python
# Create documents directory if it doesn't exist
await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(
    None, lambda: self.documents_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
)
```

## Verification Steps

Once the database connection is restored, follow these steps to verify the fixes:

### 1. Fix Database Connection

Update the `.env` file with the correct PostgreSQL password:
```bash
DOCUMENT_LOADER_DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

### 2. Test Restored File Detection

```bash
# Create a test file
echo "Test content" > /path/to/source/test.txt

# Run initial sync
document-loader sync --kb-name test-docs

# Delete the file
rm /path/to/source/test.txt

# Run sync to mark as deleted
document-loader sync --kb-name test-docs

# Restore the file
echo "Test content" > /path/to/source/test.txt

# Run sync - should detect as NEW
document-loader sync --kb-name test-docs

# Check database - file should have status='new'
document-loader status test-docs
```

### 3. Test Duplicate Deletion Prevention

```bash
# With the file still deleted, run sync multiple times
document-loader sync --kb-name test-docs
document-loader sync --kb-name test-docs

# Check database - should not have duplicate deletion records
# Query: SELECT * FROM file_record WHERE original_uri LIKE '%test.txt' ORDER BY created_at;
```

### 4. Test Error Handling

```bash
# Create a file that will fail processing (if possible)
# Run sync and verify no database constraint violations occur
```

### 5. Run Comprehensive Test

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test script
python test_comprehensive_restore.py
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. **Restored files** will be detected as NEW and processed correctly
2. **No duplicate deletion records** will be created for already-deleted files
3. **Error handling** will not cause database constraint violations
4. **Directories** will be created automatically as needed

## Test Scripts Available

- `test_restore_file.py` - Tests restored file detection
- `test_duplicate_delete.py` - Tests duplicate deletion prevention
- `test_change_detector_direct.py` - Direct unit tests for change detector logic
- `test_comprehensive_restore.py` - Full integration test
- `verify_fixes.py` - Verifies all fixes are in place

All fixes have been verified to be properly implemented in the codebase.
